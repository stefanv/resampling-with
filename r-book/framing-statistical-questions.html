<div id="introduction-5" class="section level2" number="17.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Chapters 3-10 discussed problems in probability theory. That is, we have
been estimating the probability of a composite event <em>resulting from a
system in which we know the probabilities of the simple events</em> —the
“parameters” of the situation.</p>
<p>Then Chapters 11-13 discussed the underlying philosophy of statistical
inference.</p>
<p>Now we turn to inferential-statistical problems. Up until now, we have
been estimating the complex probabilities of <em>known</em> universes—the
topic of <em>probability</em> . Now as we turn to problems in <em>statistics</em> , we
seek to learn the characteristics of an unknown system—the basic
probabilities of its simple events and parameters. (Here we note again,
however, that in the process of dealing with them, all
statistical-inferential problems eventually are converted into problems
of pure probability). To assess the characteristics of the system in
such problems, we employ the characteristics of the sample(s) that have
been drawn from it.</p>
<p>For further discussion on the distinction between inferential statistics
and probability theory, see Chapters 1-3.</p>
<p>This chapter begins the topic of <em>hypothesis testing</em> . The issue is:
whether to adjudge that a particular sample (or samples) come(s) from a
particular universe. A two-outcome yes-no universe is discussed first.
Then we move on to “measured-data” universes, which are more complex
than yes-no outcomes be-</p>
<p>cause the variables can take on many values, and because we ask somewhat
more complex questions about the relationships of the samples to the
universes. This topic is continued in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>In a typical hypothesis-testing problem presented in this chapter, one
sample of hospital patients is treated with a new drug and a second
sample is not treated but rather given a “placebo.” After obtaining
results from the samples, the “null” or “test” or “benchmark” hypothesis
would be that the resulting drug and placebo samples are drawn from the
same universe. This device of the null hypothesis is the equivalent of
stating that the drug had no effect on the patients. It is a special
intellectual strategy developed to handle such statistical questions.</p>
<p>We start with the scientific question: Does the medicine have an effect?
We then translate it into a testable statistical question: How likely is
it that the sample means come from the same universe? This process of
question-translation is the crucial step in hypothesis-testing and
inferential statistics. The chapter then explains how to solve these
problems using resampling methods after you have formulated the proper
statistical question.</p>
<p>Though the examples in the chapter mostly focus on tests of hypotheses,
the procedures also apply to confidence intervals, which will be
discussed later.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.2</span> Translating scientific questions into probabilistic and statistical questions</h2>
<p>The first step in using probability and statistics is to translate the
<em>scientific</em> question into a <em>statistical</em> question. Once you know
exactly which prob-stats question you want to ask—that is, exactly
which probability you want to determine—the rest of the work is
relatively easy (though subtle). The stage at which you are most likely
to make mistakes is in stating the question you want to answer in
probabilistic terms.</p>
<p>Though this translation is difficult, it involves no mathematics.
Rather, this step requires only hard thought. You cannot beg off by
saying, “I have no brain for math!” The need is for a brain that will do
clear thinking, rather than a brain especially talented in mathematics.
A person who uses conventional methods can avoid this hard thinking by
simply grabbing the formula for some test without understanding why s/he
chooses that test. But resampling pushes you to do this thinking
explicitly.</p>
<p>This crucial process of translating from a pre-statistical question to a
statistical question takes place in all statistical inference. But its
nature comes out most sharply with respect to testing hypotheses, so
most of what will be said about it will be in that context.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-three-types-of-questions" class="section level2" number="17.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.3</span> The three types of questions</h2>
<p>Let’s consider the natures of conceptual, operational, and statistical
questions.</p>
<p><strong>The Scientific Question</strong></p>
<p>A study for either scientific or decision-making purposes properly
begins with a general question about the nature of the world—that is,
a conceptual or theoretical question. One must then transform this
question into an operational-empirical form that one can study
scientifically. Thence comes the translation into a
technical-statistical question.</p>
<p>The scientific-conceptual-theoretical question can be an issue of
theory, or a policy choice, or the result of curiosity at large.</p>
<p>Examples include: Can a bioengineer increase the chance of female calves
being born? Is copper becoming less scarce? Are the prices of liquor
systematically different in states where the liquor stores are publicly
owned compared to states where they are privately owned? Does a new
formulation of pig rations lead to faster hog growth? Was the rate of
unemployment higher last month than the long-run average, or was the
higher figure likely to be the result of sampling error? What are the
margins of probable error for an unemployment survey?</p>
<p><strong>The Operational-Empirical Question</strong></p>
<p><em>The operational-empirical question</em> is framed in measurable quantities
in a meaningful design. Examples include: How likely is this state of
affairs (say, the new pig-food formulation) to cause an event such as
was observed (say, the observed increase in hog growth)? How likely is
it that the mean unemployment rate of a sample taken from the universe
of interest (say, the labor force, with an unemployment rate of 10
percent) will be between 11 percent and 12 percent? What is the
probability of</p>
<p>getting three girls in the first four children if the probability of a
girl is .48? How unlikely is it to get nine females out of ten calves in
an experiment on your farm? Did the price of copper fall between 1800
and the present? These questions are in the form of empirical questions,
which have already been transformed by operationalizing from
scientific-conceptual questions.</p>
<p><strong>The Statistical Question</strong></p>
<p>At this point one must decide whether the conceptual-scientific question
is of the form of either a) or b):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A test about whether some sample will frequently happen by chance
rather than being very surprising—a test of the “significance” of
a hypothesis. Such hypothesis testing takes the following form: How
likely is a given “universe” to produce <em>some</em> sample like x? This
leads to interpretation about: How likely is a given universe to be
the cause of <em>this observed</em> sample?</p></li>
<li><p>A question about the accuracy of the estimate of a parameter of the
population based upon sample evidence (an inquiry about “confidence
intervals”). This sort of question is considered by some (but not by
me) to be a question in estimation— that is, one’s best guess
about (say) the magnitude and probable error of the mean or median
of a population. This is the form of a question about confidence
limits—how likely is the mean to be between x and y?</p>
<p>Notice that the statistical question is framed as a question in
probability.</p>
<h2 id="illustrative-translations">Illustrative translations</h2>
<p>The best way to explain how to translate a scientific question into
a statistical question is to illustrate the process.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration A</strong></p>
<p>Were doctors’ beliefs as of 1964 about the harmfulness of cigarette
smoking (and doctors’ own smoking behavior) affected by the <em>social</em>
groups among whom the doctors live (Simon, 1967-1968)? That was the
<em>theoretical</em> question. We decided to define the doctors’ <em>reference
groups</em> as the <em>states</em> in which they live, because data about
doctors and smoking were available state by state ( <em>Modern
Medicine</em> , 1964). We could then translate this question into an
operational and testable <em>scientific</em> hypothesis by asking this
question: Do doctors in tobacco-economy states differ from doctors
in other states in their smoking, and in their beliefs about
smoking?</p>
<p>Which numbers would help us answer this question, and how do we
interpret those numbers? We now were ready to ask the <em>statistical</em>
question: Do doctors in tobacco-economy states “belong to the same
universe” (with respect to smoking) as do other doctors? That is, do
doctors in tobacco-economy states have the same characteristics—at
least, those characteristics we are interested in, smoking in this
case—as do other doctors? Later we shall see that the way to
proceed is to consider the statistical hypothesis that these doctors
do indeed belong to that same universe; that hypothesis and the
universe will be called “benchmark hypothesis” and “benchmark
universe” respectively—or in more conventional usage, the “null
hypothesis.”</p>
<p>If the tobacco-economy doctors do indeed belong to the benchmark
universe—that is, if the benchmark hypothesis is correct—then
there is a 49/50 chance that doctors in some state <em>other than</em> the
state in which tobacco is most important will have the highest rate
of cigarette smoking. But in fact we observe that the state in which
tobacco accounts for the largest proportion of the state’s
income—North Carolina—had (as of 1964) a higher proportion of
doctors who smoked than any other state. (Furthermore, a lower
proportion of doctors in North Carolina than in any other state said
that they <em>believed</em> that smoking is a health hazard.)</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible that it was just <em>chance</em> that North
Carolina doctors smoked most, but the chance is only 1 in 50 if the
benchmark hypothesis is correct. Obviously, <em>some</em> state had to have
the highest rate, and the chance for any other state was also 1
in 50. But, because our original <em>scientific</em> hypothesis was that
North Carolina doctors’ smoking rate would be highest, and we then
observed that it was highest even though the chance was only 1 in
50, the observation became interesting and meaningful to us. It
means that the chances are strong that there was a connection
between the importance of tobacco in the economy of a state and the
rate of cigarette smoking among doctors living there (as of 1964).</p>
<p>To consider this problem from another direction, it would be rare
for North Carolina to have the highest smoking rate for doctors if
there were no special reason for it; in fact, it would occur only
once in fifty times. But, if there <em>were</em> a special rea-</p>
<p>son—and we hypothesize that the tobacco economy provides the
reason—then it would <em>not</em> seem unusual or rare for North Carolina
to have the highest rate; therefore we choose to believe in the
not-so-unusual phenomenon, that the tobacco economy caused doctors
to smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>Like many (most? all?) actual situations, the cigarettes and
doctors’ smoking issue is a rather messy business. Did I have a
clear-cut, theoretically-derived prediction before I began? Maybe I
did a bit of “data dredging”—that is, maybe I started with a vague
expectation, and only arrived at my sharp hypothesis after I saw the
data. This would weaken the probabilistic interpretation of the test
of significance—but this is something that a scientific
investigator does not like to do because it weakens his/her claim
for attention and chance of publication. On the other hand, if one
were a Bayesian, one could claim that one had a prior probability
that the observed effect would occur, and the observed data
strengthens that prior; but this procedure would not seem proper to
many other investigators. The only wholly satisfactory conclusion is
to obtain more data—but as of 1993, there does not seem to have
been another data set collected since 1964, and collecting a set by
myself is not feasible.</p>
<p>This clearly is a case of statistical inference that one could argue
about, though perhaps it is true that <em>all</em> cases where the data are
sufficiently ambiguous as to require a test of significance are also
sufficiently ambiguous that they are properly subject to argument.</p>
<p>For some decades the hypothetico-deductive framework was the leading
point of view in empirical science. It insisted that the empirical
and statistical investigation should be preceded by theory, and only
propositions suggested by the theory should be tested. Investigators
were not supposed to go back and forth from data to theory to
testing. It is now clear that this is an ivory-tower irrelevance,
and no one lived by the hypothetico-deductive strictures
anyway—just pretended to. Furthermore, there is no sound reason to
feel constrained by it, though it strengthens your conclusions if
you had theoretical reason in advance to expect the finding you
obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration B</strong></p>
<p>Does medicine CCC cure a cancer? That’s the scientific question. So
you give the medicine to six patients who have the cancer and you do
not give it to six similar patients who have the cancer. Your sample
contains only twelve people because it is not feasible for you to
obtain a larger sample. Five of six “medicine” patients get well,
two of six “no medicine” patients get well. Does the medicine cure
the cancer? That is, if future cancer patients take the medicine,
will their rate of recovery be higher than if they did not take the
medicine?</p>
<p>One way to translate the scientific question into a statistical
question is to ask: Do the “medicine” patients <em>belong to the same
universe</em> as the “no medicine” patients? That is, we ask whether
“medicine” patients still have the <em>same</em> chances of getting well
from the cancer as do the “no medicine” patients, or whether the
medicine has bettered the chances of those who took it and thus
removed them from the original universe, with its original chances
of getting well. The original universe, to which the “no medicine”
patients must still belong, is the benchmark universe. Shortly we
shall see that we proceed by comparing the observed results against
the benchmark <em>hypothesis</em> that the “medicine” patients still belong
to the benchmark <em>universe</em> — that is, they still have the same
chance of getting well as the “no medicine” patients.</p>
<p>We want to know whether or not the medicine does any good. This
question is the same as asking whether patients who take medicine
are still in the same population (universe) as “no medicine”
patients, or whether they now belong to a different population in
which patients have higher chances of getting well. To recapitulate
our translations, we move from asking: Does the medicine cure the
cancer? to, Do “medicine” patients have the same chance of getting
well as “no medicine” patients?; and finally, to: Do “medicine”
patients belong to the same universe (population) as “no medicine”
patients? Remember that “population” in this sense does not refer to
the population at large, but rather to a group of cancer sufferers
(perhaps an infinitely large group) who have given chances of
getting well, on the average. Groups with different chances of
getting well are called “different populations” (universes). Shortly
we shall see how to <em>answer</em> this statistical question. We must keep
in mind that our ultimate concern in cases like this one is to
<em>predict future results</em> of the medicine, that is, to predict
whether use of the medicine will lead to a higher recovery rate than
would be observed without the medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration C</strong></p>
<p>Is method Alpha a better method of teaching reading than method
Beta? That is, will method Alpha produce a higher average reading
score in the future than will method Beta? Twenty children taught to
read with method Alpha have an average reading score of 79, whereas
children taught with method Beta have an average score of 84. To
translate this <em>scientific</em> question into a <em>statistical</em> question
we ask: Do children taught with method Alpha come from the same
universe (population) as children taught with method Beta? Again,
“universe” (population) does <em>not</em> mean the town or social group the
children come from, and indeed the experiment will make sense only
if the children <em>do</em> come from the same population, in that sense of
“population.” What we want to know is whether or not the children
belong to the same <em>statistical</em> population (universe), <em>defined
according to their reading ability, after they have studied</em> with
method Alpha or method Beta.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration D</strong></p>
<p>If one plot of ground is treated with fertilizer, and another
similar plot is not treated, the benchmark (null) hypothesis is that
the corn raised on the treated plot is no different than the corn
raised on the untreated lot—that is, that the corn from the
treated plot comes from (“belongs to”) the same universe as the corn
from the untreated plot. If our statistical test makes it seem very
unlikely that a universe like that from which the untreated-plot
corn comes would <em>also</em> produce corn such as came from the treated
plot, then we are willing to believe that the fertilizer has an
effect. For a psychological example, substitute the words “group of
children” for “plot,” “special training” for “fertilizer,” and “I.Q.
score” for “corn.”</p>
<p>There is nothing sacred about the benchmark (null) hypothesis of “no
difference.” You could just as well test the benchmark hypothesis
that the corn comes from a universe that averages 110 bushels per
acre, if you have reason to be especially interested in knowing
whether or not the fertilizer produces more than 110 bushels per
acre. But in many cases it is reasonable to test the probability
that a sample comes from the population that does not receive the
special treatment of medicine, fertilizer, or training.</p>
<p>So far we have discussed the scientific question and the statistical
question. Remember that there is always a generalization question,
too: Do the statistical results from this particular sample of, say,
rats apply to a universe of humans? This question can be answered
only with wisdom, common sense, and general knowledge, and not with
probability statistics.</p>
<p>Translating from a scientific question into a statistical question
is mostly a matter of asking the probability that some given
benchmark universe (population) will produce one or more observed
samples. Notice that we must (at least for general scientific
testing purposes) ask about a <em>given</em> universe whose composition we
assume to be <em>known</em> , rather than about a <em>range</em> of universes, or
about a universe whose properties are unknown. In fact, there is
really only one question that probability statistics can answer:
Given some particular benchmark universe of some stated composition,
what is the probability that an observed sample would come from it?
(Please notice the subtle but all-important difference between the
words “would come” in the previous sentence, and the word “came.”) A
variation of this question is: Given two (or more) samples, what is
the probability that they would come from the <em>same</em> universe—that
is, that the same universe would produce both of them? In this
latter case, the relevant benchmark universe is implicitly the
universe whose composition is the two samples combined.</p>
<p>The necessity for stating the characteristics of the universe in
question becomes obvious when you think about it for a moment.
Probability-statistical testing adds up to comparing a sample with a
particular benchmark universe, and asking whether there probably is
a difference between the sample and the universe. To carry out this
comparison, we ask <em>how likely</em> it is that the benchmark universe
would produce a sample like the observed sample. But in order to
find out whether or not a universe could produce a given sample, we
must ask whether or not some <em>particular</em> universe—with stated
characteristics— could produce the sample. There is no doubt that
<em>some</em> universe could produce the sample by a random process; in
fact, some universe did. The only sensible question, then, is
whether or not a <em>particular</em> universe, with stated (or known)
characteristics, is likely to produce such a sample. In the case of
the medicine, the universe with which we compare the sample who took
the medicine is the benchmark universe to which that sample would
belong if the medicine had had no effect. This comparison leads to
the benchmark (null) hypothesis that the sample comes from a
population in which the medicine (or other experimental treatment)
seems to have <em>no effect</em> . It is to avoid confusion inherent in the
term “null hypothesis” that I replace it with the term “benchmark
hypothesis.”</p>
<p>The concept of the benchmark (null) hypothesis is not easy to grasp.
The best way to learn its meaning is to see how it is used in
practice. For example, we say we are willing to be-</p>
<p>lieve that the medicine has an effect if it seems very unlikely from
the number who get well that the patients given the medicine still
belong to the same benchmark universe as the patients given no
medicine at all—that is, if the benchmark hypothesis is unlikely.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-in-statistical-inference">The steps in statistical inference</h2>
<p>These are the steps in conducting statistical inference</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Frame a question in the form of: What is the chance of
getting the observed sample x from some specified population X? For
example, what is the probability of getting a sample of 9 females
and one male from a population where the probability of getting a
single female is .48?</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Reframe the question in the form of: What kinds of
samples does population X produce, with which probabilities? That
is, what is the probability of the observed sample x (9 females in
10 calves), given that a population is X (composed of 48 percent
females)? Or in notation, what is p(x|X)?</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Actually investigate the behavior of S with respect to S
and other samples. This can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Use the calculus of probability (the formulaic method), perhaps
resorting to the Monte Carlo method if an appropriate formula
does not exist. Or</p></li>
<li><p>Resampling (in the larger sense), which equals the Monte Carlo
method minus its use for approximations, investigation of
complex functions in statistics and other theoretical
mathematics, and non-resampling uses elsewhere in science.
Resampling in the more restricted sense includes bootstrap,
permutation, and other non-parametric methods. More about the
resampling procedure follows in the paragraphs to come, and then
in later chapters in the book.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Interpret the probabilities that result from step 3 in terms
of acceptance or rejection of hypotheses, surety of conclusions, and as
inputs to decision theory.</p>
<p>The following short definition of statistical inference summarizes the
previous four steps: Statistical inference equals the selection of a
probabilistic model to resemble the process you wish to investigate, the
investigation of that model’s behavior, and the interpretation of the
results.</p>
<p>Stating the steps to be followed in a procedure is an operational
definition of the procedure. My belief in the clarifying power of this
device (the operational definition) is embodied in the set of steps
given in Chapter 10 for the various aspects of statistical inference. A
canonical question-and-answer procedure for testing hypotheses will be
found in Chapter 19, and one for confidence intervals will be found in
Chapter 20.</p>

<div id="summary-2" class="section level2" number="17.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.4</span> Summary</h2>
<p>We define resampling to include problems in inferential statistics as
well as problems in probability as follows: <em>Using the entire set of
data you have in hand, or using the given data-generating mechanism
(such as a die) that is a model of the process you wish to understand,
produce new samples of simulated data, and examine the results of those
samples</em> . That’s it in a nutshell. In some cases, it may also be
appropriate to amplify this procedure with additional assumptions.</p>
<p>Problems in pure probability may at first seem different in nature than
problems in statistical inference. But the same logic as stated in this
definition applies to both varieties of problems. The difference is that
in probability problems the “model” is known in advance—say, the model
implicit in a deck of poker cards plus a game’s rules for dealing and
counting the results—rather than the model being assumed to be best
estimated by the observed data, as in resampling statistics.</p>
<p>The hardest job in using probability statistics, and the most important,
is to <em>translate</em> the scientific question into a form to which
statistics can give a sensible answer. You must translate scientific
questions into the appropriate form for <em>statistical operations</em> , so
that you know which operations to perform. This is the part of the job
that requires hard, clear thinking— though it is non-mathematical
thinking—and it is the part that someone else usually cannot easily do
for you.</p>
<p>Once you know exactly which probability-statistical question you want to
ask—that is, exactly which probability you want to determine—the
rest of the work is relatively easy. The stage at which you are most
likely to make mistakes is in stating the question you want to answer in
probabilistic terms. Though this step is hard, <em>it involves no
mathematics</em> . This step requires only <em>hard, clear thinking</em> . You
cannot beg off by saying “I have no brain for math!” To flub this step
is to admit that you have no brain for clear thinking, rather than no
brain for mathematics.</p>
