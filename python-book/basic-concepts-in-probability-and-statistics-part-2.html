<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Basic Concepts in Probability and Statistics, Part 2</h1>
<p>This chapter may be skipped by those anxious to reach the actual
machinery of estimating probabilities.</p>
<div id="the-relationship-of-probability-to-other-magnitudes" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> The relationship of probability to other magnitudes</h2>
<p>An important argument in favor of approaching the concept of probability
with the concept of the operational definition is that an estimate of a
probability often (though not always) is the opposite side of the coin
from an estimate of a physical quantity such as time or space.</p>
<p>For example, uncertainty about the probability that one will finish a
task within 9 minutes is another way of labeling the uncertainty that
the time required to finish the task will be less than 9 minutes. Hence,
if an operational definition is appropriate for time in this case, it
should be equally appropriate for probability. The same is true for the
probability that the quantity of radios sold will be between 200 and 250
units.</p>
<p>Hence the concept of probability, and its estimation in any particular
case, should be no more puzzling than is the “dual” concept of time or
distance or quantities of radios. That is, lack of certainty about the
probability that an event will occur is not different in nature from
lack of certainty about the amount of time or distance in the event.
There is no essential difference between whether a part 2 inches in
length will be the next to emerge from the machine, or what the length
of the next part will be, or the length of the part that just emerged
(if it has not yet been measured).</p>
<p>The information available for the measurement of (say) the length of a
car or the location of a star is exactly the same in-</p>
<p>formation that is available with respect to the concept of probability
in those situations. That is, one may have ten disparate observations of
an auto’s length which then constitute a probability distribution, and
the same for the altitude of a star in the heavens. All the more reason
to see the parallel between Einstein’s concept of <em>time</em> and <em>length</em> as
being what you measure on a clock and on a meter stick,
respectively—or better, that time and length are <em>equivalent to</em> the
<em>measurements</em> that one makes on a clock or meter stick—and the notion
that <em>probability</em> should be defined by the measurements made on a clock
or a meter stick. Seen this way, all the discussions of logical and
empirical notions of probability may be seen as being made obsolete by
the Einsteinian invention of the operational definition, just as
discussions of absolute space and time were made obsolete by it.</p>
<p>Or: Consider having four different measurements of the length of a model
auto. Which number should we call the length? It is standard practice to
compute the mean. But the mean could be seen as a weighted average of
each observation by its probability. That is:</p>
<p>(.25 * 20 inches + .25 * 22 inches...) = mean model length, instead
of (20 + 22 + ...) / 4 = mean model length</p>
<p>This again makes clear that the decimal weights we call “probabilities”
have no extraordinary properties when discussing frequency series; they
are just weights we put on some other values.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the view outlined above has absolutely no
negative implications for the formal mathematical theory of probability.</p>
<p>In a book of puzzles about probability (Mosteller, 1965/1987, #42),
this problem appears: “If a stick is broken in two at random, what is
the average length of the smaller piece?” This particular puzzle does
not even mention probability explicitly, and no one would feel the need
to write a scholarly treatise on the meaning of the word “length” here,
any more than one would one do so if the question were about an
astronomer’s average observation of the angle of a star at a given time
or place, or the average height of boards cut by a carpenter, or the
average size of a basketball team. Nor would one write a treatise about
the “meaning” of “time” if a similar puzzle involved the average time
between two bird calls. Yet a rephrasing of the problem reveals its tie
to the concept of probability, to wit: What is the probability that the
smaller piece will be (say) more than half the length of the larger
piece? Or, what is the probability distribution of the sizes of the
shorter piece?</p>
<p>The duality of the concepts of probability and physical entities also
emerges in Whitworth’s discussion <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whitworth1897dcc" role="doc-biblioref">1897</a>)</span> of fair betting odds:</p>
<p>…What sum ought you fairly give or take now, while the event is
undetermined, in exchange for the assurance that you shall receive a
stated sum (say $1,000) if the favourable event occur? The chance of
receiving</p>
<p>$1,000 is worth something. It is not as good as the certainty of
receiving $1,000, and therefore it is worth less than $1,000. But the
prospect or expectation or chance, however slight, is a commodity which
may be bought and sold. It must have its price somewhere between zero
and $1,000. (p. xix.)</p>
<p>…And the ratio of the expectation to the full sum to be received is
what is called the chance of the favourable event. For instance, if we
say that the chance is 1/5, it is equivalent to saying that $200 is the
fair price of the contingent $1,000. (p. xx.)…</p>
<p>The fair price can sometimes be calculated mathematically from <em>a
priori</em> considerations: sometimes it can be deduced from statistics,
that is, from the recorded results of observation and experiment.
Sometimes it can only be estimated generally, the estimate being founded
on a limited knowledge or experience. If your expectation depends on the
drawing of a ticket in a raffle, the fair price can be calculated from
abstract considerations: if it depend upon your outliving another
person, the fair price can be inferred from recorded statistics: if it
depend upon a benefactor not revoking his will, the fair price depends
upon the character of your benefactor, his habit of changing his mind,
and other circumstances upon the knowledge of which you base your
estimate. But if in any of these cases you determine that $300 is the
sum which you ought fairly to accept for your prospect, this is
equivalent to saying that your chance, whether calculated or estimated,
is 3/10... (p. xx.)</p>
<p>It is indubitable that along with frequency data, a wide variety of
other information will affect the odds at which a reasonable person will
bet. If the two concepts of probability stand on a similar footing here,
why should they not be on a similar footing in <em>all</em> discussion of
probability? Why should both kinds of information not be employed in an
operational definition of probability? I can think of no reason that
they should not be so treated.</p>
<p>Scholars write about the “discovery” of the concept of probability in
one century or another. But is it not likely that even in pre-history,
when a fisherperson was asked how long the big fish was, s/he sometimes
extended her/his arms and said, “About this long, but I’m not exactly
sure,” and when a scout was asked how many of the enemy there were, s/he
answered, “I don’t know for sure...probably about fifty.” The
uncertainty implicit in these statements is the functional equivalent of
probability statements. There simply is no need to make such heavy work
of the probability concept as the philosophers and mathematicians and
historians have done.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-concept-of-chance" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> The concept of chance</h2>
<p>The study of probability focuses on randomly generated events—that is,
events about which there is uncertainty whether or not they will occur.
And the uncertainty refers to your knowledge rather than to the event
itself. For example, consider this lecture illustration with a salad
spoon.</p>
<p>I spin the salad spoon like a baton twirler. If I hold it at the handle
and attempt to flip it so that it turns only half a revolution, I can be
almost sure that I will correctly get the spoon end and not the handle.
And if I attempt to flip it a full revolution, again I can almost surely
get the handle successfully. It is not a random event whether I catch
the handle or the head (here ignoring those throws when I catch neither
end) when doing only half a revolution or one revolution. The result is
quite predictable in both these simple maneuvers so far.</p>
<p>When I say the result is “predictable,” I mean that you would not bet
with me about whether this time I’ll get the spoon or the handle end. So
we say that the outcome of my flip aiming at half a revolution is not
“random.”</p>
<p>When I twirl the spoon so little, I <em>control</em> (almost completely)
whether it comes down the handle or the spoon end; this is the same as
saying that the outcome does not occur by chance.</p>
<p>The terms “random” and “chance” implicitly mean that you believe that I
cannot control or cannot know in advance what will happen.</p>
<p>Whether this twirl will be the rare time I miss, however, <em>should</em> be
considered chance. Though you would not bet at even odds on my catching
the handle versus the spoon end if there is to be only a half or one
full revolution, you might bet—at (say) odds of 50 to 1—whether I’ll
make a mistake and get it wrong, or drop it. So the very same flip can
be seen as random or determined depending on what aspect of it we are
looking at.</p>
<p>Of course you would not bet <em>against</em> me about my <em>not</em> making a
mistake, because the bet might <em>cause</em> me to make a mistake purposely.
This “moral hazard” is a problem that emerges when a person buys life
insurance and may commit suicide, or when a boxer may lose a fight
purposely. The people who stake money on those events say that such an
outcome is “fixed” (a very appropriate word) and not random.</p>
<p>Now I attempt more difficult maneuvers with the ladle. I can do 1-1\2
flips pretty well, and two full revolutions with some success—maybe
even 2-1/2 flips on a good day. But when I get much beyond that, I
cannot determine very well whether I’ll get handle or spoon. The outcome
gradually becomes less and less predictable—that is, more and more
random.</p>
<p>If I flip the spoon so that it revolves three or more times, I can
hardly control the process at all, and hence I cannot predict well
whether I’ll get the handle or the head. With 5 revolutions I have
absolutely no control over the outcome; I cannot predict the outcome
better than 50-50. At that point, getting the handle or the spoon end
has become a very random event for our purposes, just like flipping a
coin high in the air. So at that point we say that “chance” controls the
outcome, though that word is just a synonym for my lack of ability to
control and predict the outcome. “Chance” can be thought to stand for
the myriad small factors that influence the outcome.</p>
<p>We see the same gradual increase in randomness with increasing numbers
of shuffles of cards. After one shuffle, a skilled magician can know
where every card is, and after two shuffles there is still much order
that s/he can work with. But after (say) five shuffles, the magician no
longer has any power to predict and control, and the outcome of any draw
can then be thought of as random chance.</p>
<p>At what point do we say that the outcome is “random” or “pure chance” as
to whether my hand will grasp the spoon end, the handle, or at some
other spot? <em>There is no sharp boundary to this transition.</em> Rather, the
transition is gradual; this is the crucial idea, and one that I have not
seen stated before.</p>
<p>Whether or not we refer to the outcome as random depends upon the
twirler’s skill, which influences how predictable the event is. A baton
twirler or juggler might be able to do ten flips with a non-random
outcome; if the twirler is an expert and the outcome is highly
predictable, we say it is not random but rather is determined.</p>
<p>Again, this shows that the randomness is not a property of the physical
event, but rather of a person’s knowledge and skill.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-we-mean-by-chance" class="section level2" number="6.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> What Do We Mean by “Chance”?</h2>
<p>We have defined “chance” as the absence of predictive power and/or
explanation and/or control. Here we should not confuse the concepts of
determinacy-indeterminacy and predictable-unpredictable. What matters
for <em>decision purposes</em> is whether you can predict. Whether the process
is “really” determinate is largely a matter of definition and labeling,
an unnecessary philosophical controversy for our operational purposes
(and perhaps for any other purpose). Much more discussion of this
general topic may be found in my forthcoming book <em>The Philosophy and
Practice of Resampling Statistics.</em></p>
<p>The ladle in the previous demonstration <em>becomes</em> unpredictable—that
is, random—even though it still is subject to similar physical
processes as when it is predictable. I do not deny <em>in principle</em> that
these processes can be “understood,” or that one could produce a machine
that would—like a baton twirler—make the course of the ladle
predictable for many turns. But in practice we cannot make the
predictions—and it is the practical reality, rather than the
principle, that matters here.</p>
<p>When I flip the ladle half a turn or one turn, I control (almost
completely) whether it comes down at the handle end or the spoon end, so
we do not say that the outcome is chance. Much the same can be said
about what happens to the predictability of drawing a given card as one
increases the number of times one shuffles a deck of cards.</p>
<p>Consider, too, a set of fake dice that I roll. Before you know they are
fake, you assume that the probabilities of various outcomes is a matter
of chance. But after you know that the dice are loaded, you no longer
assume that the outcome is chance. This illustrates how the
probabilities you work with are influenced by your knowledge of the
facts of the situation.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this way of thinking about probability takes some getting
used to. For example, suppose a magician does a simple trick with dice
such as this one:</p>
<p>The magician turns his back while a spectator throws three dice on the
table. He is instructed to add the faces. He then picks up any <em>one</em>
die, adding the number on the <em>bottom</em> to the previous total. This same
die is rolled again. The number it now shows is also added to the total.
The magician turns around. He calls attention to the fact that he has no
way of knowing which of the three cubes was used for the second roll. He
picks up the dice, shakes them in his hand a moment, then correctly
announces the final sum.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Before the magician picks up the dice he totals their faces.
Seven <span class="math display">\[the opposite sides of the dice always add to seven\]</span> added to
this number gives the total obtained by the spectator. (Gardner, 1956,
pp. 42-44).</p>
<p>Can the dice’s sum really be random if the magician knows exactly what
it is—as you also could, if you knew the trick? Forget about “really,”
I suggest, and accept that this simply is a useful way of thinking.</p>
<p>Later we will talk about the famous draft lottery where the balls were
not well mixed and the outcomes did not all have the same probabilities,
but where we still consider the lottery “fair.”</p>
<p>Later on we shall also consider the distributions of heights of various
groups of living things (including people). When we consider all living
things taken together, the shape of the overall distribution—many
individuals at the tiny end where the viruses are found, and very few
individuals at the tall end where the giraffes are—is determined
mostly by the distribution of species that have different mean heights.
Hence we can explain the shape of that distribution, and we do not say
that is determined by “chance.” But with a homogenous cohort of a single
species—say, all 25-year-old human females in the U.S.—our best
description of the shape of the distribution is “chance.” With
situations in between, the shape is partly due to identifiable
factors—e.g. age—and partly due to “chance.”</p>
<p>Or consider the case of a basketball shooter: What causes her or him to
make (or not make) a basket this shot, after a string of successes? Only
chance, because the “hot hand” does not exist. But what causes a given
shooter to be very good or very poor relative to other players? For that
explanation we can point to such factors as the amount of practice or
natural talent.</p>
<p>Again, all this has nothing to do with whether the mechanism is “really”
chance, unlike the arguments that have been raging in physics for a
century. That is the point of the ladle demonstration. Our knowledge and
our power to predict the outcome gradually transits from non-chance
(that is, “determined”) to chance (“not determined”) in a gradual way
even though the same sort of physical mechanism produces each throw of
the ladle.</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned that when we say that chance controls the outcome of
the spoon flip after (say) five revolutions, we mean that there are many
small forces that affect the outcome. The effect of each force is not
known, and each is independent of the other. None of these forces is
large enough for me (as the spoon twirler) to deal with, or else I would
deal with it and be able to improve my control and my ability to predict
the outcome. This concept of many small influences—“small” meaning in
practice those influences whose effects cannot be identified and allowed
for—which affect the outcome and whose effects are not knowable and
which are independent of each other is fundamental in statistical
inference. This concept is the basis of the Theory of Errors and the
Central Limit Theorem, which enable us to predict how the mean of a
distribution will behave in repeated sampling from the distribution, as
will be discussed later.</p>
<!---
Check the below.  Chance <==> normal distribution.

First mention of normal distribution.  Needs introduction.

First mention of the CLT.   Not really covered later.
-->
<p>That is, the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem and of the Normal
distribution are the conditions that produce an event that we say is
chance-like.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider the relationship of this concept to the
quincunx: Therein, any one ball’s fate seems chance-like, but the
overall distribution is determined.</p>

<div id="the-philosophers-dispute-about-the-concept-of-probability" class="section level2" number="6.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> The philosophers’ dispute about the concept of probability</h2>
<p>Those who call themselves “objectivists” or “frequentists” and those who
call themselves “personalists” or “Bayesians” have been arguing for
hundreds or even thousands of years about the “nature” of probability.
The objectivists insist (correctly) that any estimation not based on a
series of observations is subject to potential bias, from which they
conclude (incorrectly) that we should never think of probability that
way. They are worried about the perversion of science, the substitution
of arbitrary assessments for value-free data-gathering. The personalists
argue (correctly) that in many situations it is not possible to obtain
sufficient data to avoid considerable judgment. Indeed, if a probability
is about the future, some judgment is <em>always</em> required—about which
observations will be relevant, and so on. They sometimes conclude
(incorrectly) that the objectivists’ worries are unimportant.</p>
<p>As is so often the case, the various sides in the argument have
different sorts of situations in mind. As we have seen, the arguments
disappear if one thinks <em>operationally</em> with respect to the <em>purpose of
the work</em> , rather than in terms of <em>properties</em> , as mentioned earlier.
(Much more about this in my book, <em>The Philosophy and Practice of
Statistics and Resampling).</em></p>
<p>Here is an example of the difficulty of focusing on the supposed
properties of the mechanism or situation: The mathematical theorist
asserts that the probability of a die falling with the “5” side up is
1/6, on the basis of the physics of equally-weighted sides. But if one
rolls a particular die a million times, and it turns up “5” less than
1/6 of the time, one surely would use the observed proportion as the
practical estimate. The probabilities of various outcomes with cheap
dice may depend upon the number of pips drilled out on a side. In 20,000
throws of a red die and 20,000 throws of a white die, the proportions of
3’s and 4’s were, respectively, .159 and .146,</p>
<p>.145 and .142 – all far below the expected proportions of .167. That
is, 3’s and 4’s occurred about 11 percent less often that if the dice
had been perfectly formed, a difference that could make a big difference
in a gambling game (Bulmer, 1979, p. 18).</p>
<p>It is reasonable to think of both the <em>engineering</em> method (the
theoretical approach) and the <em>empirical</em> method (experimentation and
data collection) as two alternative ways to estimate a probability. The
two methods use different processes and different proxies for the
probability you wish to estimate. One must adduce additional knowledge
to decide which method to use in any given situation. It is sensible to
use the empirical method when data are available. (But use both together
whenever possible.)</p>
<p>In view of the inevitably subjective nature of probability estimates,
you may prefer to talk about “degrees of belief” instead of
probabilities. That’s fine, just as long as it is understood that we
operate with degrees of belief in exactly the same way as we operate
with probabilities. The two terms are working synonyms.</p>
<p>Most important: One cannot sensibly talk about probabilities in the
abstract, without reference to some set of facts. The topic then loses
its meaning, and invites confusion and argument. This also is a reason
why a general formalization of the probability concept does not make
sense.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-relationship-of-probability-to-the-concept-of-resampling" class="section level2" number="6.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> The relationship of probability to the concept of resampling</h2>
<p>There is no all-agreed definition of the concept of the resampling
method in statistics. Unlike some other writers, I prefer to apply the
term to problems in <em>both</em> pure probability and statistics. This set of
examples may illustrate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Consider asking about the number of hits one would expect from a
.250 (25 percent) batter in a 400 at-bat season. One would call this
a problem in “probability.” The sampling distribution of the
batter’s results can be calculated by formula or produced by Monte
Carlo simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Now consider examining the number of hits in a given batter’s
season, and asking how likely that number (or fewer) is to occur by
chance if the batter’s long-run batting average is</p>
<p>.250. One would call this a problem in “statistics.” But just as in
example (1) above, the answer can be calculated by formula or
produced by Monte Carlo simulation. And the calculation or
simulation is exactly the same as used in (1).</p>
<p>Here the term “resampling” might be applied to the simulation with
considerable agreement among people familiar with the term, but
perhaps not by all such persons.</p></li>
<li><p>Next consider an observed distribution of distances that a batter’s
hits travel in a season with 100 hits, with an observed mean of 150
feet per hit. One might ask how likely it is that a sample of 10
hits drawn with replacement from the observed distribution of hit
lengths (with a mean of 150 feet) would have a mean greater than 160
feet, and one could easily produce an answer with repeated Monte
Carlo samples. Traditionally this would be called a problem in
probability.</p></li>
<li><p>Next consider that a batter gets 10 hits with a mean of 160 feet,
and one wishes to estimate the probability that the sample would be
produced by a distribution as specified in (3). This is a problem in
statistics, and by 1996, it is common statistical practice to treat
it with a resampling method. The actual simulation would, however,
be identical to the work described in (3).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the work in (4) and (2) differ only in question (4) involving
measured data and question (2) involving counted data, there seems no
reason to discriminate between the two cases with respect to the term
“resampling.” With respect to the pairs of cases (1) and (2), and (3)
and (4), there is no difference in the actual work performed, though
there is a difference in the way the question is framed. I would
therefore urge that the label “resampling” be applied to (1) and (3) as
well as to (2) and (4), to bring out the important fact that the
procedure is the same as in resampling questions in statistics.</p>
<p>One could easily produce examples like (1) and (2) for cases that are
similar except that the drawing is without replacement, as in the
sampling version of Fisher’s permutation test— for example, a tea
taster. And one could adduce the example of prices in different state
liquor control systems (see Chapter 8) which is similar to cases (3) and (4) except that sampling without
replacement seems appropriate. Again, the analogs to cases (2) and (4)
would generally be called “resampling.”</p>
<p>The concept of resampling is defined in a more precise way in Chapter
10. Fuller discussion may be found in my <em>The Philosophy and Practice of
Statistics and Resampling</em> Conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2" number="6.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>We define “chance” as the absence of predictive power and/ or
explanation and/or control.</p>
<p>When the spoon rotates more than three or four turns I cannot control
the outcome—whether spoon or ladle end—with any accuracy. That is to
say, I cannot predict much better than 50-50 with more than four
rotations. So we then say that the outcome is determined by “chance.”</p>
<p>As to those persons who wish to inquire into what the situation “really”
is: I hope they agree that we do not need to do so to proceed with our
work. I hope all will agree that the outcome of flipping the spoon
gradually <em>becomes</em> unpredictable (random) though still subject to
similar physical processes as when predictable. I do not deny <em>in
principle</em> that these processes can be “understood,” certainly one can
develop a machine (or a baton twirler) that will make the outcome
predictable for many turns. But this has nothing to do with whether the
mechanism is “really” something one wants to say is influenced by
“chance.” This is the point of the cooking-spoon demonstration. The outcome traverses from non-chance (determined) to chance
(not determined) in a smooth way even though the physical mechanism that
produces the revolutions remains much the same over the traverse.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The idea that our aim is to advance our work in improving our
knowledge and our decisions, rather than to answer “ultimate”
questions about what is “really” true is in the same spirit as some
writing about quantum theory. In 1930 Ruarck and Urey wrote: “The
reader who feels disappointed that the information sought in solving
a dynamic problem on the quantum theory is <span class="math display">\[only\]</span>
statistical…should console himself with the thought that we seldom
need any information other than that which is given by the quantum
theory” (quoted by Cartright, 1987, p. 420).</p></li>
<li><p>This does not mean that I think that people should confine their
learning to what they need in their daily work. Having a deeper
philosophical knowledge than you ordinarily need can help you deal
with extraordinary problems when they arise.</p></li>
