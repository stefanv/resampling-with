<h1><span class="header-section-number">14</span> The Basic Ideas in Statistical Inference</h1>
<p>Probabilistic statistical inference is a crucial part of the process of
informing ourselves about the world around us. Statistics and
statistical inference help us understand our world and make sound
decisions about how to act.</p>
<p>More specifically, statistical inference is the process of drawing
conclusions about populations or other collections of objects about
which we have only partial knowledge from samples. Technically,
inference may be defined as the selection of a probabilistic model to
resemble the process you wish to investigate, investigation of that
model’s behavior, and interpretion of the results. Fuller understanding
of the nature of statistical inference comes with practice in handling a
variety of problems.</p>
<p>Until the 18th century, humanity’s extensive knowledge of nature and
technology was not based on formal probabilistic statistical inference.
But now that we have already dealt with many of the big questions that
are easy to answer without probabilistic statistics, and now that we
live in a more ramified world than in earlier centuries, the methods of
inferential statistics become ever more important.</p>
<p>Furthermore, statistical inference will surely become ever more
important in the future as we voyage into realms that are increasingly
difficult to comprehend. The development of an accurate chronometer to
tell time on sea voyages became a crucial need when Europeans sought to
travel to the New World. Similarly, probability and statistical
inference become crucial as we voyage out into space and down into the
depths of the ocean and the earth, as well as probe into the secrets of
the microcosm and of the human mind and soul.</p>
<p>Where probabilistic statistical inference is employed, the inferential
procedures may well not be the crucial element. For example, the wording
of the questions asked in a public-opinion poll may be more critical
than the statistical-inferential procedures used to discern the
reliability of the poll results. Yet we dare not disregard the role of
the statistical procedures.</p>
<div id="knowledge-without-probabilistic-statistical-inference" class="section level2" number="14.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Knowledge without probabilistic statistical inference</h2>
<p>Let us distinguish two kinds of knowledge with which inference at large
(that is, not just probabilistic statistical inference) is mainly
concerned: a) one or more <em>absolute</em> measurements on one or more
dimensions of a collection of one or more items— for example, your
income, or the mean income of the people in your country; and b)
<em>comparative</em> measurements and evaluations of two or more collections of
items (especially whether they are equal or unequal)—for example, the
mean income in Brazil compared to the mean income in Argentina. Types
(a) and (b) both include asking whether there has been a <em>change</em>
between one observation and another.</p>
<p>What is the conceptual basis for gathering these types of knowledge
about the world? I believe that our rock bottom conceptual tool is the
assumption of what we may call <em>sameness</em> , or <em>continuity</em> , or
<em>constancy</em> , or <em>repetition</em> , or <em>equality</em> , or <em>persistence</em> ;
“constancy” and “continuity” will be the terms used most frequently
here, and I shall use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Continuity is a non-statistical concept. It is a best guess about the
next point beyond the known observations, without any idea of the
accuracy of the estimate. It is like testing the ground ahead when
walking in a marsh. It is local rather than global. We’ll talk a bit
later about why continuity seems to be present in much of the world that
we encounter.</p>
<p>The other great concept in statistical inference, and perhaps in all
inference taken together, is <em>representative (usually random) sampling</em>
, to be discussed in Chapter 12. Representative sampling—which depends
upon the assumption of sameness (homogeneity) throughout the universe to
be investigated—is quite different than continuity; representative
sampling assumes that there is <em>no greater chance</em> of a connection
between any two elements that might be drawn into the sample than
between any other two elements; the order of drawing is immaterial. In
contrast, continuity assumes that <em>there is a greater</em></p>
<p><em>chance</em> of connection between two contiguous elements than between
either one of the elements and any of the many other elements that are
not contiguous to either. Indeed, the process of randomizing is a device
for doing away with continuity and autocorrelation within some bounded
closed system—the sample “frame.” It is an attempt to map (describe)
the entire area ahead using the device of the systematic survey. Random
representative sampling enables us to make probabilistic inferences
about a population based on the evidence of a sample.</p>
<p>To return now to the concept of sameness: Examples of the principle are
that we assume: a) our house will be in the same place tomorrow as
today; b) a hammer will break an egg every time you hit the latter with
the former (or even the former with the latter); c) if you observe that
the first fifteen persons you see walking out of a door at the airport
are male, the sixteenth probably will be male also; d) paths in the
village stay much the same through a person’s life; e) religious ritual
changes little through the decades; f) your best guess about tomorrow’s
temperature or stock price is that will be the same as today’s. This
principle of constancy is related to David Hume’s concept of <em>constant
conjunction</em> .</p>
<p>When my children were young, I would point to a tree on our lawn and
ask: “Do you think that tree will be there tomorrow?” And when they
would answer “Yes,” I’d ask, “Why doesn’t the tree fall?” That’s a tough
question to answer.</p>
<p>There are two reasonable bases for predicting that the tree will be
standing tomorrow. First and most compelling for most of us is that
almost all trees continue standing from day to day, and this particular
one has never fallen; hence, what has been in the past is likely to
continue. This assessment requires no scientific knowledge of trees, yet
it is a very functional way to approach most questions concerning the
trees—such as whether to hang a clothesline from it, or whether to
worry that it will fall on the house tonight. That is, we can predict
the outcome in this case with very high likelihood of being correct even
though we do not utilize anything that would be called either science or
statistical inference. (But what do you reply when your child says: “Why
should I wear a seat belt? I’ve never been in an accident”?)</p>
<p>A second possible basis for prediction that the tree will be standing is
scientific analysis of the tree’s roots—how the tree’s weight is
distributed, its sickness or health, and so on. Let’s put aside this
sort of scientific-engineering analysis for now.</p>
<p>The first basis for predicting that the tree will be standing
tomorrow—sameness—is the most important heuristic device in all of
knowledge-gathering. It is often a weak heuristic; certainly the
prediction about the tree would be better grounded (!) after a skilled
forester examines the tree. But persistence alone might be a better
heuristic in a particular case than an engineering-scientific analysis
alone.</p>
<p>This heuristic appears more obvious if the child—or the adult— were
to respond to the question about the tree with another question: Why
should I expect it to <em>fall</em> ? In the absence of some reason to expect
change, it is quite reasonable to expect no change. And the child’s new
question does not duck the central question we have asked about the
tree, any more than one ducks a probability estimate by estimating the
complementary probability (that is, unity minus the probability sought);
indeed, this is a very sound strategy in many situations.</p>
<p>Constancy can refer to location, time, relationship to another variable,
or yet another dimension. Constancy may also be cyclical. Some cyclical
changes can be charted or mapped with relative certainty—for example
the life-cycles of persons, plants, and animals; the diurnal cycle of
dark and light; and the yearly cycle of seasons. The courses of some
diseases can also be charted. Hence these kinds of knowledge have long
been well known.</p>
<p>Consider driving along a road. One can predict that the price of the
next gasoline station will be within a few cents of the gasoline station
that you just passed. But as you drive further and further, the
dispersion increases as you cross state lines and taxes differ. This
illustrates continuity.</p>
<p>The attention to constancy can focus on a single event, such as leaves
of similar shape appearing on the same plant. Or attention can focus on
single sequences of “production,” as in the process by which a seed
produces a tree. For example, let’s say you see two puppies—one that
looks like a low-slung dachshund, and the other a huge mastiff. You also
see two grown male dogs, also apparently dachshund and mastiff. If asked
about the parentage of the small ones, you are likely— using the
principle of sameness—to point—quickly and with surety—to the
adult dogs of the same breed. (Here it is important to notice that this
answer implicitly assumes that the fathers of the puppies are among
these dogs. But the fathers might be somewhere else entirely; it is in
these ways that the principle of sameness can lead you astray.)</p>
<p>When applying the concept of sameness, the object of interest may be
collections of data, as in Semmelweiss’s data on the consistent
differences in rates of maternal deaths from childbed fever in two
clinics with different conditions (see Table 11-1), or the similarities
in sex ratios from year to year in Graunt’s data on London births (Table
11-2), or the stark effect in John Snow’s data on the numbers of cholera
cases associated with two London wells (Table 11-3), or the reduction in
beriberi among Japanese sailors as a result of a change in diet (Table
11-4). These data seem so overwhelmingly clear cut that our naive
statistical sense makes the relationships seem deterministic, and the
conclusions seems straightforward. (But the same statistical sense
frequently misleads us when considering sports and stock market data.)</p>

<p>Constancy and sameness can be seen in macro structures; consider, for
example, the constant location of your house. Constancy can also be seen
in micro aggregations—for example, the raindrops and rain that account
for the predictably fluctuating height of the Nile, or the ratio of boys
to girls born in London, cases in which we can <em>average</em> to see the
“statistical” sameness. The total sum of the raindrops produces the
level of a reservoir or a river from year to year, and the sum of the
behaviors of collections of persons causes the birth rates in the
various years.</p>
<p>Statistical inference is only needed when a person thinks that s/he
<em>might</em> have found a pattern but the pattern is not completely obvious
to all. Probabilistic inference works to test— either to confirm or
discount—the belief in the pattern’s existence. We will see such cases
in the following chapter.</p>
<p>People have always been forced to think about and act in situations that
have not been constant—that is, situations where the amount of
variability in the phenomenon makes it impossible to draw clear cut,
sensible conclusions. For example, the appearance of game animals in
given places and at given times has always been uncertain to hunters,
and therefore it has always been difficult to know which target to hunt
in which place at what time. And of course variability of the weather
has always made it a very uncertain element. The behavior of one’s
enemies and friends has always been uncertain, too, though uncertain in
a manner different from the behavior of wild animals; there often is a
gaming element in interactions with other humans. But in earlier times,
data and techniques did not exist to enable us to bring statistical
inference to bear.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-treatment-of-uncertainty" class="section level2" number="14.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.2</span> The treatment of uncertainty</h2>
<p>The purpose of <em>statistical</em> inference is to help us peer through the
veil of variability when it obscures the main thrust of the data, so as
to improve the decisions we make. Statistical inference (or in most
cases, simply probabilistic estimation) can help</p>

</ol>
<p>Returning to the tree near the Simon house: Let’s change the facts.
Assume now that one major part of the tree is mostly dead, and we expect
a big winter storm tonight. What is the danger that the tree will fall
on the house? Should we spend</p>
<p>$1500 to have the mostly-dead third of it cut down? We know that last
year a good many trees fell on houses in the neighborhood during such a
storm.</p>
<p>We can gather some data on the proportion of old trees this size that
fell on houses—about 5 in 100, so far as we can tell. Now it is no
longer an open-and-shut case about whether the tree will be standing
tomorrow, and we are using statistical inference to help us with our
thinking. We proceed to find a set of trees <em>that we consider similar to
this one</em> , and study the variation in the outcomes of such trees. So
far we have estimated that the <em>average</em> for this group of trees—the
mean (proportion) that fell in the last big storm—is 5 percent.
Averages are much more “stable”—that is, more similar to each other—
than are individual cases.</p>
<p>Notice how we use the crucial concept of sameness: We assume that our
tree is like the others we observed, or at least that it is not
systematically different from most of them and it is more-or-less
average.</p>
<p>How would our thinking be different if our data were that one tree in 10
had fallen instead of 5 in 100? This is a question in statistical
inference.</p>
<p>How about if we investigate further and find that 4 of 40 <em>elms</em> fell,
but only one of 60 <em>oaks</em> , and ours is an oak tree. Should we consider
that oaks and elms have different chances of falling? Proceeding a bit
further, we can think of the question as: Should we or should we not
consider oaks and elms as different? This is the type of statistical
inference called “hypothesis testing”: We apply statistical procedures
to help us decide whether to treat the two classes of trees as the same
or different. If we should consider them the same, our worries about the
tree falling are greater than if we consider them different with respect
to the chance of damage.</p>
<p>Notice that statistical inference was not necessary for accurate
prediction when I asked the kids about the likelihood of a live tree
falling on a day when there would be no storm. So it is with most
situations we encounter. But when the assumption of constancy becomes
shaky for one reason or another, as with the sick tree falling in a
storm, we need a more refined form of thinking. We collect data on a
large number of instances, inquire into whether the instances in which
we are interested (our tree and the chance of it falling) are
representative—that is, whether it resembles what we would get if we
drew a sample randomly—and we then investigate the behavior of this
large class of instances to see what light it throws on the instances(s)
in which we are interested.</p>
<p>The procedure in this case—which we shall discuss in greater detail
later on—is to ask: If oaks and elms are <em>not</em> different, how likely
is it that only one of 60 oaks would fall whereas 4 of 40 elms would
fall? Again, notice the assumption that our tree is “representative” of
the other trees about which we have information—that it is not
systematically different from most of them, but rather that it is
more-or-less average. Our tree cer-</p>
<p>tainly was not chosen randomly from the set of trees we are considering.
But for purposes of our analysis, we proceed <em>as if</em> it had been chosen
randomly—because we deem it “representative.”</p>
<p>This is the first of two roles that the concept of randomness plays in
statistical thinking. Here is an example of the second use of the
concept of randomness: We conduct an experiment— plant elm and oak
trees at <em>randomly-selected</em> locations on a plot of land, and then try
to blow them down with a wind-making machine. (The random selection of
planting spots is important because some locations on a plot of ground
have different growing characteristics than do others.) Some purists
object that <em>only</em> this sort of experimental sampling is a valid subject
of statistical inference; it can never be appropriate, they say, to
simply <em>assume</em> on the basis of other knowledge that the tree is
representative. I regard that purist view as a helpful discipline on our
thinking. But accepting its conclusion—that one should not apply
statistical inference except to randomly-drawn or randomly-constituted
samples—would take from us a tool that has proven useful in a variety
of activities.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier in this chapter, the data in some (probably most)
scientific situations are so overwhelming that one can proceed without
probabilistic inference. Historical examples include those shown above
of Semmelweiss and puerperal fever, and John Snow and cholera. But where
there was lack of overwhelming evidence, the causation of many diseases
long remained unclear for lack of statistical procedures. This led to
superstitious beliefs and counter-productive behavior, such as
quarantines against plague often were. Some effective practices also
arose despite the lack of sound theory, however—the waxed costumes of
doctors, and the burning of mattresses, despite the wrong theory about
the causation of plague; see Cipolla, 1981)</p>
<p>So far I have spoken only of <em>predictability</em> and not of other elements
of statistical knowledge such as <em>understanding</em> and <em>control</em> . This is
simply because statistical <em>correlation</em> is the bed rock of most
scientific understanding, and predictability. Later we will expand the
discussion beyond predictability; it holds no sacred place here.</p>
<p>1 It is because hypothesis testing focuses on this most basic of
inferential processes—deciding “same” or “different”—that I believe
it to be a more basic technique than estimating confidence intervals,
which focus on the accuracy of estimates.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-statistical-inference-becomes-crucial" class="section level2" number="14.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> Where statistical inference becomes crucial</h2>
<p>There was little role for statistical inference until about three
centuries ago because there existed very few scientific data. When
scientific data began to appear, the need emerged for statistical
inference to improve the interpretation of the data. As we saw,
statistical inference is not needed when the evidence is overwhelming. A
thousand cholera cases at one well and zero at another obviously does
not require a statistical test. Neither would 999 cases to one, or even
700 cases to 300, because our inbred and learned statistical senses can
detect that the two situations are different. But probabilistic
inference is needed when the number of cases is relatively small or
where for other reasons the data are somewhat ambiguous.</p>
<p>For example, when working with the 17th century data on births and
deaths, John Graunt—great statistician though he was—drew wrong
conclusions about some matters because he lacked modern knowledge of
statistical inference. For example, he found that in the rural parish of
Romsey “there were born 15 Females for 16 Males, whereas in London there
were 13 for 14, which shows, that London is somewhat more apt to produce
Males, then the country” (p. 71). He suggests that the “curious” inquire
into the causes of this phenomenon, apparently not recognizing—and at
that time he had no way to test—that the difference might be due
solely to chance. He also notices (p. 94) that the variations in deaths
among years in Romsey were greater than in London, and he attempted to
explain this apparent fact (which is just a statistical artifact) rather
than understanding that this is almost inevitable because Romsey is so
much smaller than London. Because we have available to us the modern
understanding of variability, we can now reach sound conclusions on
these matters.</p>
<p>Summary statistics—such as the simple mean—are devices for reducing
a large mass of data (inevitably confusing unless they are absolutely
clear cut) to something one can manage to understand. And probabilistic
inference is a device for determining whether patterns should be
considered as facts or artifacts.</p>
<p>Here is another example that illustrates the state of early quantitative
research in medicine:</p>
<p>Exploring the effect of a common medicinal substance, Boecker examined
the effect of sasparilla on the nitrogenous and other constituents of
the urine. An individual receiving a controlled diet was given a
decoction of sasparilla for a period of twelve days, and the volume of
urine passed daily was carefully measured. For a further twelve days
that same individual, on the same diet, was given only distilled water,
and the daily quantity of urine was again determined. The first series
of researches gave the following figures (in cubic centimeters): 1,467,
1,744, 1,665, 1,220, 1,161, 1,369, 1,675, 2,199, 887, 1,634, 943,</p>
<p>and 2,093 (mean = 1,499); the second series: 1,263,</p>
<p>1,740, 1,538, 1,526, 1,387, 1,422, 1,754, 1,320, 1,809,</p>
<p>2,139, 1,574, and 1,114 (mean = 1,549). Much uncertainty surrounded the
exactitude of these measurements, but this played little role in the
ensuing discussion. The fundamental issue was not the quality of the
experimental data but how inferences were drawn from those data (Coleman
in Kruger, 1987, p. 207).</p>
<p>The experimenter Boecker had no reliable way of judging whether the data
for the two groups were or were not meaningfully different, and
therefore he arrived at the unsound conclusion that there was indeed a
difference. (Gustav Radicke used this example as the basis for early
work on statistical significance.)</p>
<p>Another example: Joseph Lister convinced the scientific world of the
germ theory of infection, and the possibility of preventing death with a
disinfectant, with these data: Prior to the use of antiseptics—16
post-operative deaths in 35 amputations; subsequent to the use of
antiseptics—6 deaths in 40 amputations (Winslow, 1943, p. 303). But
how sure could one be that a difference of that size might not occur
just by chance? No one then could say, nor did anyone inquire,
apparently.</p>
<p>Here’s another example of great scientists falling into error because of
a too-primitive approach to data (Feller, 3rd ed, 1968, pp. 69-70):
Charles Darwin wanted to compare two sets of measured data, each
containing 16 observations. At Darwin’s request, Francis Galton compared
the two sets of data by ranking each, and then comparing them pairwise.
The a’s were ahead 13 times. Without knowledge of the actual
probabilities Galton concluded that the treatment was effective. But,
assuming perfect randomness, the probability that the a’s beat <span class="math display">\[the
others\]</span> 13 times or more equals 3/16. This means that in three out of
sixteen cases a perfectly ineffectual treatment would appear as good or
better than the treatment classified as effective by Galton.</p>
<p>That is, Galton and Darwin reached an unsound conclusion. As Feller
says, “This shows that a quantitative analysis may be a valuable
supplement to our rather shaky intuition” (p. 70).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the key tool in situations like Graunt’s and Boecker’s
and Lister’s is creating <em>ceteris paribus</em> —making “everything else
the same”—with random selection in experiments, or at least with
statistical controls in non-experimental situations.</p>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level2" number="14.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.4</span> Conclusions</h2>
<p>In all knowledge-seeking and decision-making, our aim is to peer into
the unknown and reduce our uncertainty a bit. The two main concepts that
we use—the two great concepts in all of scientific knowledge-seeking,
and perhaps in all practical thinking and decision-making—are a)
continuity (or non-randomness) and the extent to which it applies in
given situation, and b) random sampling, and the extent to which we can
assume that our observations are indeed chosen by a random process.</p>
