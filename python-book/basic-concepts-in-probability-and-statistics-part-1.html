<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Basic Concepts in Probability and Statistics, Part 1</h1>
<p>“Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but
must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting
fairy tales.”</p>
<p>Bertrand Russell, <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em></p>
<p>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945, p. xiv)</p>
<div id="introduction-1" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The central concept for dealing with uncertainty is probability. Hence
we must inquire into the “meaning” of the term probability. (The term
“meaning” is in quotes because it can be a confusing word.)</p>
<p>You have been using the notion of probability all your life when drawing
conclusions about what you expect to happen, and in reaching decisions
in your public and personal lives.</p>
<p>You wonder: Will the footballer’s kick from the 45 yard line go through
the uprights? How much oil can you expect from the next well you drill,
and what value should you assign to that prospect? Will you be the first
one to discover a completely effective system for converting speech into
computer-typed output? Will the next space shuttle end in disaster? Your
answers to these questions rest on the probabilities you estimate.</p>
<p>And you act on the basis of probabilities: You place your blanket on the
beach where there is a low probability of someone’s kicking sand on you.
You bet heavily on a poker hand if there is a high probability that you
have the best hand. A hospital decides not to buy another ambulance when
the administrator judges that there is a low probability that all the
other ambulances will ever be in use at once. NASA decides whether or
not to send off the space shuttle this morning as scheduled.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses what is meant by such key terms as “probability,”
“conditional” and “unconditional” probability, “independence,” “sample,”
and “universe.” It discusses the nature and the usefulness of the
concept of probability as used in this book, and it touches on the
source of basic estimates of probability that are the raw material of
statistical inferences. The chapter also distinguishes between
probability theory and inferential statistics. (Descriptive statistics,
the other main branch of statistics, was discussed briefly in the
previous chapter.)</p>
</div>
<div id="the-nature-and-meaning-of-the-concept-of-probability" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> The nature and meaning of the concept of probability</h2>
<p>The common meaning of the term “probability” is as follows: <em>Any
particular stated probability is an assertion that indicates how likely
you believe it is that an event will occur</em> .</p>
<p>It is confusing and unnecessary to inquire what probability “really” is.
(Indeed, the terms “really” and “is,” alone or in combination, are major
sources of confusion in statistics and in other logical and scientific
discussions, and it is often wise to avoid their use.) Various concepts
of probability—which correspond to various common definitions of the
term—are useful in particular contexts (see Ayer, 1965; Schlaifer,
1961, Chapter 1; for perhaps the best summary of the probability
concept, see Barnett, 1973, Chapter 3). This book contains many examples
of the use of probability. Work with them will gradually develop a sound
understanding of the concept.</p>
<p>There are two major concepts and points of view about
probability—frequency and belief. Each is useful in some situations
but not in others. Though they may seem incompatible in principle, there
almost never is confusion about which is appropriate in a given
situation.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Frequency</em> . The probability of an event can be said to be the
proportion of times that the event has taken place in the past,
usually based on a long series of trials. Insurance companies use
this when they estimate the probability that a thirty-five-year-old
postman will die during a period for which he wants to buy an
insurance policy. (Notice this shortcoming: Sometimes you must bet
upon events that have never or only infrequently taken place before,
and so you cannot reasonably reckon the proportion of times they
occurred one way or the other in the past.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Belief</em> . The probability that an event will take place or that a
statement is true can be said to correspond to the odds at which you
would bet that the event will take place. (Notice a shortcoming of
this concept: You might be willing to accept a five-dollar bet at
2-1 odds that your team will win the game, but you might be
unwilling to bet a hundred dollars at the same odds.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The connection between gambling and immorality or vice troubles some
people about gambling examples. On the other hand, the racy aspects can
give the subject a special tang. There are several reasons why
statistics use so many gambling examples—and especially tossing coins,
throwing dice, and playing cards:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Historical</em> . The theory of probability began with gambling
examples of dice analyzed by Cardano, Galileo, and then by Pascal
and Fermat.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Generality</em> . These examples are not related to any particular walk
of life, and therefore they can be generalized to applications in
any walk of life. Students in any field—business, medicine,
science—can feel equally at home with gambling examples.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sharpness</em> . These examples are particularly stark, and
unencumbered by the baggage of particular walks of life or special
uses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Universality</em> . Every other text uses these same examples, and
therefore the use of them connects up this book with the main body
of writing about probability and statistics.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Often we’ll begin with a gambling example and then consider an example
in one of the professional fields—such as business and other
decision-making activities, biostatistics and medicine, social science
and natural science—and everyday living. People in one field often can
benefit from examples in others; for example, medical students should
understand the need for business decision-making in terms of medical
practice, as well as the biostatistical examples. And social scientists
should understand the decision-making aspects of statistics if they have
any interest in the use of their work in public policy.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-meaning-of-probability" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> The “Meaning” of “Probability”</h2>
<p>A probability estimate of .2 indicates that you think there is twice as
great a chance of the event happening as if you had estimated a
probability of .1. This is the rock-bottom interpretation of the term
“probability,” and the heart of the concept.</p>
<p>The idea of probability arises when you are not sure about what will
happen in an uncertain situation—that is, when you lack information
and therefore can only make an estimate. For example, if someone asks
you your name, you do not use the concept of probability to answer; you
know the answer to a very high degree of surety. To be sure, there is
some chance that you do not know your own name, but for all practical
purposes you can be quite sure of the answer. If someone asks you who
will win tomorrow’s ball game, however, there is a considerable chance
that you will be wrong no matter what you say. Whenever there is a
reasonable chance that your prediction will be wrong, the concept of
probability can help you.</p>
<p>The concept of probability helps you to answer the question, “How likely
is it that…?” The purpose of the study of probability and statistics
is to help you make sound appraisals of statements about the future, and
good decisions based upon those appraisals. The concept of probability
is especially useful when you have a sample from a larger set of
data—a “universe”—and you want to know the probability of various
degrees of likeness between the sample and the universe. (The universe
of events you are sampling from is also called the “population,” a
concept to be discussed below.) Perhaps the universe of your study is
all high school seniors in 1997. You might then want to know, for
example, the probability that the universe’s average SAT score will not
differ from your sample’s average SAT by more than some arbitrary number
of SAT points—say, ten points.</p>
<p>I’ve said that a probability statement is about the future. Well,
usually. Occasionally you might state a probability about your future
knowledge of past events—that is, “I think I’ll find out
that...”—or even about the unknown past. (Historians use
probabilities to measure their uncertainty about whether events occurred
in the past, and the courts do, too, though the courts hesitate to say
so explicitly.)</p>
<p>Sometimes one knows a probability, such as in the case of a gambler
playing black on an honest roulette wheel, or an insurance company
issuing a policy on an event with which it has had a lot of experience,
such as a life insurance policy. But often one does not <em>know</em> the
probability of a future event. Therefore, our concept of probability
must include situations where extensive data are not available.</p>
<p>All of the many techniques used to estimate probabilities should be
thought of as <em>proxies</em> for the actual probability. For example, if
Mission Control at Space Central simulates what should and probably will
happen in space if a valve is turned aboard a space craft just now being
built, the test result on the ground is a proxy for the real probability
of what will happen in space.</p>
<p>In some cases, it is difficult to conceive of <em>any</em> data that can serve
as a proxy. For example, the director of the CIA, Robert Gates, said in
1993 “that in May 1989, the CIA reported that the problems in the Soviet
Union were so serious and the situation so volatile that Gorbachev had
only a 50-50 chance of surviving the next three to four years unless he
retreated from his reform policies” ( <em>The Washington Post</em> , January
17, 1993, p. A42). Can such a statement be based on solid enough data to
be more than a crude guess?</p>
<p>The conceptual probability in any specific situation is <em>an
interpretation of all the evidence that is then available</em> . For
example, a wise biomedical worker’s estimate of the chance that a given
therapy will have a positive effect on a sick patient should be an
interpretation of the results of not just one study in isolation, but of
the results of that study plus everything else that is known about the
disease and the therapy. A wise policymaker in business, government, or
the military will base a probability estimate on a wide variety of
information and knowledge. The same is even true of an insurance
underwriter who bases a life-insurance or shipping-insurance rate not
only on extensive tables of long-time experience but also on recent
knowledge of other kinds. The choice of a method of estimating a
probability constitutes an <em>operational definition</em> of probability.</p>
</div>
<div id="digression-about-operational-definitions" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Digression about Operational Definitions</h2>
<p>An operation definition is the all-important intellectual procedure that
Einstein employed in his study of special relativity to sidestep the
conceptual pitfalls into which discussions of such concepts as
probability also often slip. An operational definition is to be
distinguished from a property or attribute definition, in which
something is defined by saying what it consists of. For example, a crude
attribute definition of a college might be “an organization containing
faculty and students, teaching a variety of subjects beyond the
high-school level.” An operational definition of university might be “an
organization found in <em>The World Almanac’s</em> listing of ‘Colleges and
Universities.’” (Simon, 1969, p. 18.)</p>
<p>P. W. Bridgman, the inventor of operational definitions, stated that
“the proper definition of a concept is not in terms of its properties
but in terms of actual operations.” It was he who explained that
definitions in terms of properties had held physics back and constituted
the barrier that it took Albert Einstein to crack (Bridgman, 1927, pp.
6-7).</p>
<p>A formal operational definition of “operational definition” may be
appropriate. “A definition is an operational definition to the extent
that the definer (a) specifies the procedure (including materials used)
for identifying or generating the definiendum and (b) finds high
reliability for <span class="math display">\[consistency in application of\]</span> his definition” (Dodd,
in <em>Dictionary of Social Science</em> , p. 476). A. J. Bachrach adds that
“the operational definition of a dish ... is its recipe” (Bachrach,
1962, p. 74).</p>
<p>The language of empirical scientific research is made up of instructions
that are descriptions of sets of actions or operations (for instance,
“turn right at the first street sign”) that someone can follow
accurately. Such instructions are called an “operational definition.” An
operational definition contains a specification of all operations
necessary to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>The language of science also contains theoretical terms (better called
“hypothetical terms”) that are not defined operationally.</p>
</div>
<div id="back-to-proxies" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Back to Proxies</h2>
<p>Example of a proxy: The “probability risk assessments” (PRAs) that are
made for the chances of failures of nuclear power plants are based, not
on long experience or even on laboratory experiment, but rather on
theorizing of various kinds— using pieces of prior experience wherever
possible, of course. A PRA can cost a nuclear facility $5 million.</p>
<p>Another example: If a manager looks at the sales of radios in the last
two Decembers, and on that basis guesses how likely it is that he will
run out of stock if he orders 200 radios, then the last two years’
experience is serving as a proxy for future experience. If a sales
manager just “intuits” that the odds are 3 to 1 (a probability of .75)
that the main competitor will not meet a price cut, then all his past
experience summed into his intuition is a proxy for the probability that
it will really happen. Whether any proxy is a good or bad one depends on
the wisdom of the person choosing the proxy and making the probability
estimates.</p>
<p>How does one estimate a probability in practice? This involves practical
skills not very different from the practical skills required to estimate
with accuracy the length of a golf shot, the number of carpenters you
will need to build a house, or the time it will take you to walk to a
friend’s house; we will consider elsewhere some ways to improve your
practical skills in estimating probabilities. For now, let us simply
categorize and consider in the next section various ways of estimating
an ordinary garden variety of probability, which is called an
“unconditional” probability.</p>

<p>Consider the probability of drawing an even-numbered spade from a deck
of poker cards (consider the queen as even and the jack and king as
odd). Here are several general methods of estimation, the specifics of
which constitute an operational definition of probability in this
particular case:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Experience.</strong></p>
<p>The first possible source for an estimate of the probability of
drawing an even-numbered spade is the purely empirical method of
<em>experience</em> . If you have watched card games casually from time to
time, you might simply guess at the proportion of times you have
seen even-numbered spades appear— say, “about 1 in 15” or “about 1
in 9” (which is almost correct) or something like that. (If you
watch long enough you might come to estimate something like 6 in
52.)</p>
<p>General information and experience are also the source for
estimating the probability that the sales of radios this December
will be between 200 and 250, based on sales the last two Decembers;
that your team will win the football game tomorrow; that war will
break out next year; or that a United States astronaut will reach
Mars before a Russian astronaut. You sim-</p>
<p>ply put together all your relevant prior experience and knowledge,
and then make an educated guess.</p>
<p>Observation of repeated events can help you estimate the probability
that a machine will turn out a defective part or that a child can
memorize four nonsense syllables correctly in one attempt. You watch
repeated trials of similar events and record the results.</p>
<p>Data on the mortality rates for people of various ages in a
particular country in a given decade are the basis for estimating
the probabilities of death, which are then used by the actuaries of
an insurance company to set life insurance rates. This is
<em>systematized experience</em> —called a <em>frequency series</em> .</p>
<p>No frequency series can speak for itself in a perfectly objective
manner. Many judgments inevitably enter into compiling every
frequency series—deciding which frequency series to use for an
estimate, choosing which part of the frequency series to use, and so
on. For example, should the insurance company use only its records
from last year, which will be too few to provide as much data as is
preferable, or should it also use death records from years further
back, when conditions were slightly different, together with data
from other sources? (Of course, no two deaths—indeed, no events of
any kind—are <em>exactly</em> the same. But under many circumstances they
are <em>practically</em> the same, and science is only interested in such
“practical” considerations.)</p>
<p>In view of the necessarily judgmental aspects of probability
estimates, the reader may prefer to talk about “degrees of belief”
instead of probabilities. That’s fine, just as long as it is
understood that we operate with degrees of belief in exactly the
same way as we operate with probabilities; the two terms are working
synonyms.</p>
<p>There is no <em>logical</em> difference between the sort of probability
that the life insurance company estimates on the basis of its
“frequency series” of past death rates, and the manager’s estimates
of the sales of radios in December, based on sales in that month in
the past two years.</p>
<p>The concept of a probability based on a frequency series can be
rendered meaningless when all the observations are repetitions of a
single magnitude—for example, the case of all successes and zero
failures of space-shuttle launches prior to the Challenger shuttle
tragedy in the 1980s; in those data alone there was no basis to
estimate the probability of a shuttle failure. (Probabilists have
made some rather peculiar attempts over the centuries to estimate
probabilities from the length of a zero-defect time series—such as
the fact that the sun has never failed to rise (foggy days
aside!)—based on the undeniable fact that the longer such a series
is, the smaller the probability of a failure; see e.g., Whitworth,
1897/1965, pp. xix-xli. However, one surely has more information on
which to act when one has a long series of observations of the same
magnitude rather than a short series).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulated experience.</strong></p>
<p>A second possible source of probability estimates is empirical
scientific investigation with repeated trials of the phenomenon.
This is an empirical method even when the empirical trials are
simulations. In the case of the even-numbered spades, the empirical
scientific procedure is to shuffle the cards, deal one card, record
whether or not the card is an even-number spade, replace the card,
and repeat the steps a good many times. The proportions of times you
observe an even-numbered spade come up is a probability estimate
based on a frequency series.</p>
<p>You might reasonably ask why we do not just <em>count</em> the number of
even-numbered spades in the deck of fifty-two cards. No reason at
all. But that procedure would not work if you wanted to estimate the
probability of a baseball batter getting a hit or a cigarette
lighter producing flame.</p>
<p>Some varieties of poker are so complex that experiment is the only
feasible way to estimate the probabilities a player needs to know.</p>
<p>The resampling approach to statistics produces estimates of most
probabilities with this sort of experimental “Monte Carlo” method.
More about this later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sample space analysis and first principles.</strong></p>
<p>A third source of probability estimates is <em>counting the
possibilities</em> —the quintessential theoretical method. For
example, by examination of an ordinary die one can determine that
there are six different numbers that can come up. One can then
determine that the probability of getting (say) either a “1” <em>or</em> a
“2,” on a single throw, is 2/6 = 1/3, because two among the six
possibilities are “1” or “2.” One can similarly determine that there
are two possibilities of getting a “1” <em>plus</em> a “6” out of
thirty-six possibilities when rolling two dice, yielding a
probability estimate of 2/36 = 1/18.</p>
<p>Estimating probabilities by counting the possibilities has two
requirements: 1) that the possibilities all be known (and there-</p>
<p>fore limited), and few enough to be studied easily; and 2) that the
probability of each particular possibility be known, for example,
that the probabilities of all sides of the dice coming up are equal,
that is, equal to 1/6.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical shortcuts to sample-space analysis.</strong></p>
<p>A fourth source of probability estimates is <em>mathematical
calculations</em> . If one knows by other means that the probability of
a spade is 1/4 and the probability of an even-numbered card is 6/13,
one can then calculate that the probability of turning up an
even-numbered spade is 6/52 (that is, 1/4 x 6/13). If one knows that
the probability of a spade is 1/4 and the probability of a heart is
1/4, one can then calculate that the probability of getting a heart
<em>or</em> a spade is 1/2 (that is 1/4 + 1/4). The point here is not the
particular calculation procedures, but rather that one can often
calculate the desired probability on the basis of already-known
probabilities.</p>
<p>It is possible to estimate probabilities with mathematical
calculation only if one knows <em>by other means</em> the probabilities of
some related events. For example, there is no possible way of
mathematically calculating that a child will memorize four nonsense
syllables correctly in one attempt; empirical knowledge is
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kitchen-sink methods.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the above four categories of estimation procedures, the
statistical imagination may produce estimates in still other ways such
as a) the salesman’s seat-of-the-pants estimate of what the
competition’s price will be next quarter, based on who-knows-what
gossip, long-time acquaintance with the competitors, and so on, and b)
the probability risk assessments (PRAs) that are made for the chances of
failures of nuclear power plants based, not on long experience or even
on laboratory experiment, but rather on theorizing of various kinds—
using pieces of prior experience wherever possible, of course. Any of
these methods may be a combination of theoretical and empirical methods.</p>
<p>Consider the estimation of the probability of failure for the tragic
flight of the Challenger shuttle, as described by the famous physicist
Nobelist Richard Feynman. This is a very real case that includes just
about every sort of complication that enters into estimating
probabilities.</p>
<p>…Mr. Ullian told us that 5 out of 127 rockets that he had looked at
had failed—a rate of about 4 percent. He took that 4 percent and
divided it by 4, because he assumed a manned flight would be safer than
an unmanned one. He came out with about a 1 percent chance of failure,
and that was enough to warrant the destruct charges.</p>
<p>But NASA <span class="math display">\[the space agency in charge\]</span> told Mr. Ullian that the
probability of failure was more like 1 of 10 <sup>5</sup> .</p>
<p>I tried to make sense out of that number. “Did you say 1 in 10 <sup>5</sup> ?”</p>
<p>“That’s right; 1 in 100,000.”</p>
<p>“That means you could fly the shuttle <em>every day</em> for an average of <em>300
years</em> between accidents—every day, one flight, for 300 years—which
is obviously crazy!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” said Mr. Ullian. “I moved my number up to 1 in 1000 to
answer all of NASA’s claims—that they were much more careful with
manned flights, that the typical rocket isn’t a valid comparison,
etcetera.”</p>
<p>But then a new problem came up: the Jupiter probe, <em>Galileo</em> , was going
to use a power supply that runs on heat generated by radioactivity. If
the shuttle carrying <em>Galileo</em> failed, radioactivity could be spread
over a large area. So the argument continued: NASA kept saying 1 in
100,000 and Mr. Ullian kept saying 1 in 1000, at best.</p>
<p>Mr. Ullian also told us about the problems he had in trying to talk to
the man in charge, Mr. Kingsbury: he could get appointments with
underlings, but he never could get through to Kingsbury and find out how
NASA got its figure of 1 in 100,000 (Feynman, 1989, pp. 179–180).
Feynman tried to ascertain more about the origins of the figure of 1 in
100,000 that entered into NASA’s calculations. He performed an
experiment with the engineers:</p>
<p>…“Here’s a piece of paper each. Please write on your paper the answer
to this question: what do you think is the probability that a flight
would be uncompleted due to a failure in this engine?”</p>
<p>They write down their answers and hand in their papers. One guy wrote
“99-44/100% pure” (copying the Ivory soap slogan), meaning about 1 in
200. Another guy wrote something very technical and highly quantitative
in the standard statistical way, carefully defining everything, that I had to translate—which also meant about 1 in
\200. The third guy wrote, simply, “1 in 300.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lovingood’s paper, however, said, Cannot quantify. Reliability is
judged from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>past experience</p></li>
<li><p>quality control in manufacturing</p></li>
<li><p>engineering judgment</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Well,” I said, “I’ve got four answers, and one of them weaseled.” I
turned to Mr. Lovingood: “I think you weaseled.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I weaseled.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell me <em>what</em> your confidence was, sir; you told me <em>how</em>
you determined it. What I want to know is: after you determined it, what
<em>was</em> it?”</p>
<p>He says, “100 percent”—the engineers’ jaws drop, my jaw drops; I look
at him, everybody looks at him—“uh, uh, minus epsilon!”</p>
<p>So I say, “Well, yes; that’s fine. Now, the only problem is, WHAT IS
EPSILON?”</p>
<p>He says, “10 <sup>-5</sup> .” It was the same number that Mr. Ullian had told us
about: 1 in 100,000.</p>
<p>I showed Mr. Lovingood the other answers and said, “You’ll be interested
to know that there <em>is</em> a difference between engineers and management
here—a factor of more than 300.”</p>
<p>He says, “Sir, I’ll be glad to send you the document that contains this
estimate, so you can understand it.”</p>
<p><sup>*</sup> Later, Mr. Lovingood sent me that report. It said things like “The
probability of mission success is necessarily very close to 1.0”—does
that mean it <em>is</em> close to 1.0, or it <em>ought to be</em> close to 1.0?—and
“Historically, this high degree of mission success has given rise to a
difference in philosophy between unmanned and manned space flight
programs; i.e., numerical probability versus engineering judgment.” As
far as I can tell, “engineering judgment” means they’re just going to
make up numbers! The probability of an engine-blade failure was given as
a universal constant, as if all the blades were exactly the same, under
the same conditions. The whole paper was quantifying everything. Just
about every nut and bolt was in there: “The chance that a HPHTP pipe
will burst is 10 <sup>-7</sup> .” You can’t estimate things like that; a
probability of 1 in 10,000,000 is almost impossible to estimate. It was
clear that the numbers for each part of the engine were chosen so that
when you add everything together you get 1 in 100,000. (Feynman, 1989,</p>
<p>pp. 182-183).</p>
<p>We see in the Challenger shuttle case very mixed kinds of inputs to
actual estimates of probabilities. They include frequency series of past
flights of other rockets, judgments about the relevance of experience
with that different sort of rocket, adjustments for special temperature
conditions (cold), and much much more. There also were complex
computational processes in arriving at the probabilities that were made
the basis for the launch decision. And most impressive of all, of
course, are the extraordinary differences in estimates made by various
persons (or perhaps we should talk of various statuses and roles) which
make a mockery of the notion of objective estimation in this case.</p>
<p>Working with different sorts of estimation methods in different sorts of
situations is not new; practical statisticians do so all the time. The
novelty here lies in making no apologies for doing so, and for raising
the practice to the philosophical level of a theoretically-justified
procedure—the theory being that of the operational definition.</p>
<p>The concept of probability varies from one field of endeavor to another;
it is different in the law, in science, and in business. The concept is
most straightforward in decision-making situations such as business and
gambling; there it is crystal-clear that one’s interest is entirely in
making accurate predictions so as to advance the interests of oneself
and one’s group. The concept is most difficult in social science, where
there is considerable doubt about the aims and values of an
investigation. In sum, one should not think of what a probability “is”
but rather how best to estimate it. In practice, neither in actual
decision-making situations nor in scientific work—nor in classes—do
people experience difficulties estimating probabilities because of
philosophical confusions. Only philosophers and mathematicians
worry—and even they really do not <em>need</em> to worry—about the
“meaning” of probability.</p>
